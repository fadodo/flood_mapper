# flood_mapper/utils.py
"""
This module provides essential utility functions to support the flood mapping process
within the flood_mapper package. It includes functionalities for:
- Calculating the area of Earth Engine images, typically used for flood extent.
- Loading and parsing Geographic Information System (GIS) data, specifically GeoJSON files,
  to define the Area of Interest (AOI) for analysis.
- Performing consistency checks on pixel counts between different Earth Engine images,
  which is crucial for reliable change detection.
- Exporting processed Earth Engine images as assets to your Google Earth Engine account
  for persistent storage and further use.

        image (ee.Image): The Earth Engine image whose unmasked pixels' area is to be calculated.

                       will be performed. A smaller scale provides higher precision but requires
                       more computation.
