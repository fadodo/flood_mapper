"""
This module provides functions for flood detection using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.
It includes functionality to compute Otsu's threshold for flood extent detection,
detect flood extent, and calculate flood duration based on a collection of flood extent images.
It is designed to work with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and requires the GEE library to be initialized.
